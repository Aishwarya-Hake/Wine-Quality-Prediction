# Wine-Quality-Prediction
The wine quality prediction project is an application of machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties.The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the quality of wine based on the chemical properties such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and sugar level.

Data preprocessing: The first step in this project is to collect and preprocess the data. The dataset of wine samples with their corresponding quality ratings is collected and preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies or missing data. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The next step is to perform EDA on the preprocessed data to gain insights into the data distribution, trends, and relationships between different variables. This involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and hypothesis testing. For example, you can use box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and relationships between different variables.

Feature Engineering: After EDA, the next step is to extract relevant features from the dataset that can be used to train the model. This involves selecting and transforming the features to improve the model's accuracy. For example, you can create new features by combining existing features, standardizing the features, or applying non-linear transformations.

Model Building: Once the features are engineered, the next step is to build the machine learning model. There are several machine learning algorithms that can be used to predict the quality of wine, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The performance of each algorithm is measured using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Model Tuning: After the model is built, the next step is to tune the model to improve its performance. This involves optimizing the hyperparameters of the machine learning algorithm, such as learning rate, regularization parameters, and number of trees in the random forest. Cross-validation techniques can be used to find the optimal hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation: Once the model is fine-tuned, the next step is to evaluate its performance on a test dataset. This involves measuring the model's accuracy using evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

Visualization: The final step is to visualize the results of the model to communicate insights and predictions to stakeholders. This involves creating interactive dashboards, scatter plots, and bar charts to showcase the model's performance and insights. For example, you can use a scatter plot to show the relationship between the predicted quality and the actual quality of wine.
